# RealTimeBusTracker
This application displays a map of a section of Cambridge, Massachusetts and adds an animated marker to highlight the bus route between MIT and Harvard.
# How to Run
Click "Show stops between MIT and Harvard" to see a marker moving from one bus stop to the next on the map.
# Roadmap of Future Improvements
To improve this application, the MBTA bus data could be verified before the code is run. A daily bus schedule could also be overlayed on the page. GPS data could be used as well to provide real-time updates to the position marker in the future.
